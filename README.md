# AIDraft
### Simple Notes App With AI-Powered summaries

Find this app useful for taking notes, saving them by user-basis and summarize your notes on several levels (short, average or detailed) by just pressing a button. Accept the summary or give additional instructions within the application.

## Initialization
This is the monorepo entry, move to `aidraft-server` for running the server, and find the detailed instructions on how to start It within the folder. For client, move to `aidraft-client` and follow the instructions within that folder too.

For server use `pnpm install` for dependencies and on client `npm install`. Do not install any dependencies on this level of the repository.
